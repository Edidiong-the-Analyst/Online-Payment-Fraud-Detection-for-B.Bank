# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection-for-B.Bank



Blossom Bank (BB) PLC wants to build a Machine Learning model that will predict online payment fraud. The Objective of this project was to develop a model that will proactively monitor for potentially fraudulent.
Information about transactions carried out in the bank were recorded in rows and columns and sent as a csv file. The Data was a clean data, as such no cleaning was done, except column renaming for readability and visualization. Exploratory Analysis was carried out on the data to understand the data better. Four (4) Machine Learning Algorithms were used for the project, after which they were evaluated using different metrics for the best performance, for deployment.
The Algorithms used were Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine. The dataset was slitted into train and test data at 70:30 ration; the models were trained and tested using the dataset, after which evaluated using Cross Validation (K-Fold, Precision and Recall)
For this business problem, Recall score is of more relevancy, and RandomForest Classifier has highest recall score of 68% compared to other models. Hence, It should be deployed by Blossom Bank PLC for Online Payment Fraud detection, as it has 68% Recall and Accuracy score of 99%.
